        "3. NameError: This exception is raised when you try to access a variable or function that hasn't been defined yet.\n",

        "\n",
        "These are just a few examples of the types of exceptions you might encounter while coding in Python. Exception handling provides benefits like easy error detection and debugging, maintaining code readability, and focusing on program logic. It helps in writing cleaner and more maintainable code.\n"
